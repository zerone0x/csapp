> C programs, processor architecture, program optimizations, the memory hierarchy, linking, exceptional control flow (exceptions, interrupts, processes, and Unix signals), virtual memory and memory management, system-level I/O, basic network programming, and concurrent programming

- Integer is finite, so it didn't follow a+b=b+a sometimes

3 times each chapter and practice by the lab

Machine to represent data:
	[[datalab]]
	[[bomblab]] 
		use #gdb to make breakpoint
		read assemble lang
	[[attacklab]]  oriented programming
[[cachelab]] memory hierarchy and exploit
[[tshlab]] hardware to softwoare(process,signal,)
	`exceptional control flow called set jump and long jump in C`
	wow^
[[malloclab]] virtual memory *abstract for sys*
	`write own malloc and free func`
	very sophisticated
[[proxylab]] IO --> network programming --> socket(basic)
